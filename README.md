szluug-jmx-demo
===============

This project was created to demonstrate Java Management Extensions
on the Szczecin Linux/Unix Users Group meeting.

It shows developers how to easily enable JMX in their applications.
It also contains the simplest possible HTTP daemon written
in Java which might serve as an interesting example on its own.
